# 💾 Week 3 Compaction Summary

💻 Google Interview Prep: Pattern Summary (Linked Lists)
Completed 12 of 12 core Week 3 problems.

Day|Focus Topic|Problems Solved|Core Pattern|Time Complexity Goal
|---|---|---|---|---|
Day 1|Sentinel Nodes|"21. Merge Sorted| 203. Remove Elements"|Dummy Node Technique|O(N)
Day 2|Two-Pointer Motion|"141. Cycle| 142. Cycle II| 160. Intersection"|"Fast/Slow (Floyd’s)| Path Alignment"|O(N)

# 💾 Week 4 Compaction Summary

💻 Google Interview Prep: Week 4 Summary (Stacks & Queues)
Day|Focus Topic|Problems Solved|Core Pattern|Complexity Goal
---|---|---|---|---
Day 1|Interface Design|232. Implement Queue using Stacks|Double-Stack Reversal (Pouring)|O(1) Amortized
Day 2|Structure Rotation|225. Implement Stack using Queues|One-Queue Rotation|O(N) Push
Day 3|String Parsing|"71. Simplify Path| 150. Eval RPN"|"Path Simulation| Postfix Evaluation"|O(N)
Day 4|Nested Logic|"394. Decode String| 22. Generate Parentheses"|"State Checkpoints| Constrained Backtracking"|O(N) / O(2n)
Day 5|Monotonic Stack I|"496. Next Greater I| 739. Daily Temperatures"|Decreasing Stack (Lookahead for Greater)|O(N)

Day 7|Finale Challenge|84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram|Increasing Stack + Sentinel (Flush)|O(N)

Key Takeaways/Mindset:
- Monotonic Property: Used stacks to find "Next/Previous Smaller/Greater" elements in $O(N)$ by maintaining a specific order and "pruning" useless data.
- Sentinel Pattern: Added dummy values (like 0 in Histogram) to handle boundary conditions and flush remaining stack elements automatically.
- Indices over Values: Storing indices in the stack is more powerful than storing values, as indices provide both the value ($arr[i]$) and the distance/width.


# 💾 Week 5 Compaction Summary (Trees)
Copy the block below for your next session context.

## 💻 Google Interview Prep: Tree Week Summary (Days 22-28)
Completed all 18 core Tree problems| including Hard tier.

Day|Focus Topic|Problems Solved|Core Pattern|Complexity
---|---|---|---|---
Day 1|BFS/DFS Basics|"102. Level Order| 104. Max Depth| 226. Invert Tree"|"Level-Order Queue| Recursive DFS"|O(N)
Day 2|Balance & Path|"110. Balanced Tree| 543. Diameter| 112. Path Sum"|"Bottom-up Height Check| Global Max Tracking"|O(N)
Day 3|Ancestors|"236. LCA| 572. Subtree of Another Tree"|"Path Bubbling| Recursive Identity Check"|O(N)
Day 4|Views|199. Binary Tree Right Side View|BFS Level-End Capture / DFS Depth-Map|O(N)
Day 5|Structure|"114. Flatten| 116. Next Pointers| 105. Construct Tree"|"Reverse Post-order| Pointer Stitching| Map-Inorder"|O(N)
Day 6|BST Logic|"98. Validate BST| 235. LCA (BST)| 230. Kth Smallest"|"Range Boundaries| Split-point Logic| Inorder Counter"|O(H)
Day 7|Hard Boss|"124. Max Path Sum| 297. Serialize/Deserialize"|"Post-order ""Gain"" vs ""Split""| Sentinel Pre-order"|O(N)

**Key Technical Takeaways:**
- Pointer Management: Mastered in-place tree mutation (Flattening) and iterative $O(1)$ space connectivity.
- Sentinel Values: Used "X" or "null" in serialization to represent structure in a 1D string.
- BST Optimization: Utilized $Left < Root < Right$ to prune search spaces and validate constraints via pointers (*int) to handle MinInt64 edge cases.
- Go Specifics: Optimized string building with strings.Join and used closure-based recursion with slice pointers for "Read-Head" state management.

**Mindset**: Focused on identifying whether info flows "Top-Down" (Level-order/Prefix) or "Bottom-Up" (Post-order/Path Sums).

Final Thought Before Graphs
In Trees, you always had a single "Root" and a clear downward direction. In Graphs, you will lose those luxuries. You’ll need to track "Visited" nodes to avoid infinite loops and handle multiple disconnected "Islands" of data.
