# 🏁 Wrap-up: Week 6 | Day 5

### Thought & Mindset
Today was about Abstraction. We didn't search through an array; we searched through the number line itself. Whether it's finding a Peak by looking at slopes or finding a Square Root by looking at squares, the core idea is: If I can define a "True/False" condition for any point in my range, I can use Binary Search.
### The Pattern: Search on Answer
If you see a problem asking for the "Minimum $X$ such that..." or "Maximum $Y$ such that...", and the property is monotonic (e.g., if 10 works, 11 also works), you are likely looking at a Binary Search on Answer problem.
