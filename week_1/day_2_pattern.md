🧠 Pattern: The "Greedy" State TrackerFormal Name: Greedy Algorithm (specifically, keeping track of local extremes to find a global optimum).The Intuition: The "Future-Blind" WalkerImagine you are walking down a path and you can never turn back. You encounter opportunities (prices) one by one.The Constraint: You cannot change the past (you can't buy at yesterday's price now).The Goal: You want to find the best pair of events (Buy & Sell) where the "Buy" happened before the "Sell."The mindset is: "I don't need to know the future to make the best decision for right now."At any specific step, you ask two questions:Is this the cheapest thing I've ever seen? (If yes, "remember" it as the new baseline).If I sold right now, is this the most money I could make? (Compare current price minus your baseline against your record profit).🔍 How to Recognize This PatternWatch for these signals in a problem description:Strict Order Dependency: "Day i must come before Day j" or "Find indices i < j such that..."Contrast: In "Two Sum," i and j could be anywhere. In "Stock," i must be before j. This strict order usually suggests a single forward pass."Maximize/Minimize the Difference": You are looking for a delta between two numbers.Stream Processing: The problem feels like you are reading data as it comes in (like a ticker tape) rather than having random access to everything at once.Compare & ContrastPatternProblem ExampleKey CharacteristicHash MapTwo SumOrder doesn't matter.
