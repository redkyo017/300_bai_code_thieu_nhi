### 🎓 Week 1 Summary & Next Steps
Congratulations! You have completed Week 1: Core Fundamentals and mastered seven essential patterns:

|Pattern|Problems Solved|Core Idea|
|---|---|---|
Hash Map|Two Sum, Valid Anagram, First Unique Char|$O(1)$ History Lookups / Frequency Counting|
|Stack (LIFO)|Valid Parentheses|Order of Dependency Management|
|Greedy/Single Pass|Best Time to Buy Stock|Tracking Local State (Min Price, Max Profit)|
|Two Pointers (Converging)|Valid Palindrome, Two Sum II, Container|Symmetrical/Sorted Array Optimization|
|Sliding Window|Longest Substring, Min Window Substring|Dynamic Subarray/Substring Validation in $O(N)$|
Interval Management|Merge Intervals|Sorting by Start Time + Single Pass Merging|
|Prefix/Suffix Sum|Product Except Self|Two-Pass Accumulation for $O(N)$ result
|Expand Around Center|Longest Palindromic Substring|Two Pointers from a Center Point|
