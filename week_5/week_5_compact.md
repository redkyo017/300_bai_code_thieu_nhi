**Key Technical Takeaways:**
- Pointer Management: Mastered in-place tree mutation (Flattening) and iterative $O(1)$ space connectivity.
- Sentinel Values: Used "X" or "null" in serialization to represent structure in a 1D string.
- BST Optimization: Utilized $Left < Root < Right$ to prune search spaces and validate constraints via pointers (*int) to handle MinInt64 edge cases.
- Go Specifics: Optimized string building with strings.Join and used closure-based recursion with slice pointers for "Read-Head" state management.

**Mindset**: Focused on identifying whether info flows "Top-Down" (Level-order/Prefix) or "Bottom-Up" (Post-order/Path Sums).

Final Thought Before Graphs
In Trees, you always had a single "Root" and a clear downward direction. In Graphs, you will lose those luxuries. You’ll need to track "Visited" nodes to avoid infinite loops and handle multiple disconnected "Islands" of data.
